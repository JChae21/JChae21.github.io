My research is in the area of visual analytics. More specifically, my research focuses on
designing new visual analytics systems by combining human analytical capabilities (e.g., visual
processing, cognition) and data analytics techniques (e.g., machine learning, data mining) for
human intelligence amplification to address tasks that were previously too large or too
complex. I earned my Ph.D. degree from Purdue University in 2016. My doctoral research was
conducted under the direction of Professor David S. Ebert. During my Ph.D. study, I was
focusing on visual analytics of a large volume of spatial and temporal data (e.g., location-based
social networks) for anomaly and predictive analysis, such as anomalous human movement
analysis, abnormal event detection, and human crowd flow prediction. I participated in many
projects to solve many problems of government agents including U.S. Coast Guard, police
departments, and intelligence agencies, which resulted in making strong impacts on the enduser
communities. Also, I published 12 research papers (3 short papers) in top-tier conferences
and journals such as IEEE VIS, EuroVIS, Computer & Graphics, Computer Graphics Forum.
