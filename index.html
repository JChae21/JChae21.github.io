	Hi, I am a Research Scientist in the <a href="https://csmd.ornl.gov/group/visualization" style="color:#338CFF;"> Visualization Group </a> in the Computer Science & Mathematics Division at the <a href="https://www.ornl.gov/" style="color:#42C834;"> Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) </a>.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	I am interested in <b>human intelligence amplification to address previously too large or too complex tasks through visual analytics</b>.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	My research focuses on building visual analytics tools and platforms by combining human analytical capabilities (e.g., visual processing and cognition) and data analytics techniques (e.g., machine learning, data mining, and deep learning).
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Since I have joined ORNL, I have been focusing on visual analytics for enhancing human-understandable explanations of AI technologies. I have developed multiple visual analytics systems that help the developers understand their models and results and build insights to improve their models.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	I earned my Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/" style="color:#BCA428;"> Purdue University </a> in 2016. My doctoral research was conducted under the direction of Professor David S. Ebert. Before the doctoral study, I was a software engineer in many industrial fields: security, computer network, and electronic commerce.
